        		<h1>Hey there, I'm Marc!</h1>
				<p>I have a pretty big family and it consists of me, my mother Kristina, my dad Mark, 
					and my three little brothers Matthew, Micah, and Maddox. This group of people
					mean the world to me and I would do anything for them. To extend our family, I have 
					12 cousins that I see daily and some which who come to school with me here at 
					James Campbell High School. My brothers and I are all athletes and love to be together
					on our free times by singing kareoke, dancing, and overall just having a good time. I 
					am the eldest out of my siblings, so I always have an upper hand on my knuckle head 
					little brothers and I love them no matter what.  </p>
		<h2>What are my hobby's?</h2>
			<p> I like to work out and play football on my freetime. I played all three of my seasons 
				here at Campbell (freshman, sophomore, and junior year). I am looking forward to my 
				off season this year and created a schedule to work out. I also like to cruise with 
				my friends when im not doing much and we create tik toks and overall just have a good time,
				never a bad vibe. When at parties I also sing a little kareoke.  </p>
		<h3>What do I want?</h3>
			        <p> I want my family and others around me to be proud of me. I want to be successful
					and make six figures in the future. For my ideal lifestyle in the future, it would be me, my wife
					and maybe two of my kids cruising in the living room after i'd finish work. I want to maintain a 
					good reputation as a good kid and the one who could always put a smile on peoples face. </p>

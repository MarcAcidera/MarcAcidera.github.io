        		<h1>Hey there, I'm Marc!</h1>
				<p>I'm best known as your friendly neighborhood spiderman. I'm kidding,
				I was raised in Ewa Beach on the Island of Oahu and I grew up eating spicy ahi rolls and zip pacs. 
                    I also love my family a lot and want to give them the world. To get things started, I was born
                    on June 29, 2003 and my 
            ethnicities are Filipino, Chinese, and spanish. I am a 4.0 GPA
            student and currently a junior
            that plays for the Campbell Sabers football team. I put others
            before myself and show leadership skills while working in groups
            or even as a team. Teamwork has always been a specialty of mine by
            making sure that we get things done on time and doing what 
            I have to do as an individual.I have dreams to be able to support 
            my family in every way and
            going to college maybe even for football. I have been playing
            the sport since I was five and found a passion for it. My favorite 
            subject is math because numbers come easy to me and involves a lot
            of trial and error. I want to be an engineer or an electrician by 
            the age of 25 because these jobs also involve math and working in 
            groups. I've been to all of the Hawaiian Islands except Molokai and visit 
	   family in San Jose every year. In the future, I hope to have lots of 
	    money and a beautiful loving family. I will continue to praise God and
	   keep friends and family close until I die.

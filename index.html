        		<h1>Hey there, I'm Marc Acidera!</h1>
				<p>I'm best known as your friendly neighborhood spiderman. I'm kidding, my names Marc and
                I was raised in Ewa Beach on the Island of Oahu and I grew up eating spicy ahi rolls and zip pacs. 
                    I also love my family a lot and want to give them the world. To get things started, I was born
                    on June 29, 2003 and my 
            ethnicities are Filipino, Chinese, and spanish. I am a 4.0 GPA
            student and currently a junior
            that plays for the Campbell Sabers football team. I put others
            before myself and show leadership skills while working in groups
            or even as a team. Teamwork has always been a specialty of mine by
            making sure that we get things done on time and doing what 
            I have to do as an individual.I have dreams to be able to support 
            my family in every way and
            going to college maybe even for football. I have been playing
            the sport since I was five and found a passion for it. My favorite 
            subject is math because numbers come easy to me and involves a lot
            of trial and error. I want to be an engineer or an electrician by 
            the age of 25 because these jobs also involve math and working in 
            groups.
